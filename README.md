## Description
This is a game of pong that runs in the command prompt, originally done in Spring 2019 in COP 2001 Programming Methodology with Professor Paul Allen.

The Player uses the 'W' and 'S' keys to move their paddle up or down, while the Ai paddle chases the ball with some error to allow the user the chance to win.
